# Vite React Electron Template

This template is used to develop cross-platform desktop web-app using Vite, React and Electron

## GitHub Action

- Build tests are run with GitHub Actions
- When you draft a new release, release is automatically created and the installer `exe`, `deb`, `dmg` files are automatically provided in artifacts(assets)

## Development

> If you want to see it in your browser instead of Electron, run `pnpm build` and `pnpm preview`.  
> Then you can preview it like the default Vite at `localhost:3000`

- `pnpm install` - Install Dependencies
- `pnpm dev`- Run Electron
